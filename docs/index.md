# RadioSpiral Desktop
### A streaming audio player for the [https://spiral.radio](RadioSpiral) stream

RadioSpiral Desktop provides a tiny (low memory footprint and small screen real estate)
player for RadioSpiral.

We want to make sur eall of our listeners can easily access the stream, so we provide a
number of ways to listen:

 - A widget on our website at [https://spiral.radio](https://spiral.radio)
 - An iOS app, (also )runnable on M-series Macs with Ventura or greater)
 - This app, for our Mac-using friends running any modern Mac OS (32-bit _or_ 64-bit).

This app provides a minimal interface: play/pause and the title and artist. That's it!
