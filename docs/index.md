# RadioSpiral Desktop
### A miniplayer for [RadioSpiral](https://radiospiral.net)

Radiospiral provides both a player on our website 
and an app via the App Store for both iOS and M-series Macs, but
some of our listeners don't have modern Macs: some even still have 32-bit ones.

And maybe you as a listener just want a tiny (both in screen real estate and in memory footprint) app to play music from our station.

_That's RadioSpiral Desktop._

It provides the minimum you need to listen to our 24/7 stream of captivating electronica.

 - a play/pause button
 - the current artist and track.

That's it! We do have the logo over there on the left and we plan to make that a
thumbnail of the cover a bit later, but for now there's your minimum to listen.

Enjoy!
